Great clarification!

Let‚Äôs now **translate the Supplier Performance Scorecard** into a **business perspective** for manufacturers ‚Äî with both **value impact** and **math formulas** used.

---

## üè≠ Business Problem

Manufacturers supplying products (e.g., olive oil) to various **retailers across regions** need to answer:

> **Which suppliers or distributors are reliably fulfilling demand across different regions ‚Äî and which ones are underperforming?**

---

## ‚úÖ What We Solved

We created a **Supplier Performance Scorecard**, which shows:

| Metric                  | What It Measures                                     | Why It Matters to Manufacturer                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fulfillment Rate**    | % of customer demand met by supplier                 | Tells if supplier is delivering enough stock on time    |
| **Forecast Deviation**  | Difference between predicted demand and actual sales | Indicates if the manufacturer is forecasting accurately |
| **Inventory Level**     | Average inventory the supplier is holding            | Helps reduce stockouts or overstock risk                |
| **Total Units Ordered** | Volume of products ordered                           | Used for prioritizing supplier relationships            |

## üìê Key Formulas Used

### 1. Fulfillment Rate

```math
Fulfillment Rate (%) = (Units Sold / Demand Forecast) √ó 100
```

* **Ideal Range**: 90%‚Äì97%
* **Too Low**: Risk of stockouts and lost sales
* **Too High (e.g., 100%)**: Might be overpromising (unsustainable)

---

### 2. Forecast Deviation

```math
Forecast Deviation = |Demand Forecast ‚àí Units Sold|
```

* **Low Deviation** = Good demand prediction
* **High Deviation** = May indicate overproduction or underproduction

---

### 3. Reorder Quantity

```math
Reorder Qty = max(0, Demand Forecast ‚àí Inventory Level)
```

* **Used in Restock Alerts** to tell how much extra to send

## üíº Business Benefits for Manufacturers

| Benefit                                   | Description                                                                             | KPI Improved            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| üìâ **Reduce Lost Sales**                  | By identifying low-fulfillment suppliers, manufacturers can reallocate inventory faster | Sales Uplift            |
| üîÑ **Improve Forecasting**                | Monitoring deviations sharpens future planning & reduces buffer stock                   | Forecast Accuracy       |
| üèÜ **Performance-Based Partner Strategy** | Prioritize high-performing suppliers for discounts, incentives, or new products         | Supply Chain Efficiency |
| üì¶ **Balanced Inventory**                 | Adjust stock levels to avoid overstocking or understocking in specific regions          | Inventory Turnover      |

## üß† Example Business Insight

> ‚ÄúSupplier A in London had a fulfillment rate of **91%**, but a forecast deviation of **+400 units**. We may be **overestimating demand** there, leading to excess inventory and holding costs.‚Äù

---

## üßÆ Real-World Application: Incentive Program

You can use this scorecard to **build an incentive model**:

```math
Supplier Bonus = Base Bonus √ó Fulfillment Score √ó (1 ‚àí Forecast Deviation Factor)
```

Where:

* Fulfillment Score = Fulfillment Rate / 100
* Forecast Deviation Factor = Forecast Deviation / Demand Forecast

This rewards **accurate and reliable suppliers**, aligning business incentives with performance.
